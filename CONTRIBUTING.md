# Contributing to Awesome Local AI

Thank you for considering contributing to this list!

## Guidelines

### What to Add

- Tools, libraries, or frameworks for running AI locally
- Guides that help people set up or optimize local AI
- Model repositories and collections
- Communities and resources for learning

### What Not to Add

- Cloud-only services or APIs
- Paywalled content without free alternatives
- Abandoned projects (no commits in 12+ months)
- Self-promotional content without genuine value
- Duplicate entries

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your resource in the appropriate section
3. Use the format: `- [Name](URL) - Brief description`
4. Keep descriptions concise (under 100 characters)
5. Verify the link works
6. Submit a pull request

### Quality Standards

- Resources should be actively maintained
- Projects should have documentation
- Links should go to the primary source (official repo/site)
- Descriptions should explain why the resource is useful

### Section Organization

- Keep entries alphabetized within sections
- If a resource fits multiple categories, place it in the most relevant one
- Add new sections only if there are 3+ resources for that category
